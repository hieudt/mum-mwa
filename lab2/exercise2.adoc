1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use `setImmediate` instead of using `setTimeout`? +
* Use `setImmediate` when we want to have the callback function executed immediately after the `poll` phase has completed. +
* One use case is when we want to run a CPU-bound task like recursive computation, we should queue the iteration using `setImmediate` so that other queues like timers, I/O have a chance to run between recursive iterations. +
* Another use case is when we want to run callbacks before any timers by scheduling them using `setImmediate` within an I/O cycle, regardless of how many timers are present.

2. Explain the difference between `process.nextTick` and `setImmediate`? +
* `process.nextTick` adds the given callback function to the so-called `Priority` queue or `nextTickQueue` whose tasks get executed right after the current operation completes, irrespective of the current phase of the event loop. It's a way to invoke a callback immediately.
* `setImmediate` adds the given callback function to the `Check` phase's queue whose tasks get executed after I/O operations are finished. In other words, `setImmediate` callbacks will be triggered during the current/next iteration of the event loop.

3. Name 10 global modules available in Node environment. +
`console, fs, http, net, os, path, process, stream, child_process, net.`
